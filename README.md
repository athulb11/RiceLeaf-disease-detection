# RiceLeaf-disease-detection

## Problem Statement
Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-Create a model which can classify the three major attacking diseases of rice plants like leaf blast, bacterial blight and brown spot.

Task3:- Analyze various techniques like Data Augmentation, etc and create a report on that.

## Domain Expertise
The dataset includes 119 jpg images of rice leaves effected by different types of diseases.

The classes are:-
Bacterial Leaf Blight
Bacterial leaf blight of rice (BB) is a disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv.Bacterial leaf blight is often first noticed in fields as brown areas about 3 to 4 feet in diameter. Leaf symptoms appear as irregular brown spots, often beginning on the leaf margins. Lesions initially have an irregular yellow halo and may appear watersoaked.

Brown Spot
Brown spot is a fungal disease that can infect both seedlings and mature plants. The disease causes blight on seedlings, which are grown from heavily infected seeds, and can cause 10-58% seedling mortality.

Leaf Smut
Leaf smut, caused by the fungus Entyloma oryzae, is a widely distributed, but somewhat minor, disease of rice.The fungus produces slightly raised, angular, black spots (sori) on both sides of the leaves.The black spots are about 0.5 to 5.0 millimeters long and 0.5 to 1.5 millimeters wide. The class Leaf Smut contains 39 jpg images while rest all classes contain 40 jpg images.

## Conclusion:-
The dataset contains 119 jpg images of different diseases.

Here,we had tried 4 Optimizers for model creation in which Adam Optimizer shows the higher accuracy of 87.50%.Thus we can conclude that it works well for the Rice Leaf Disease Detection.

By using the Adam Optimizer we tried it with the 100 samples of test data and it showed a great output and later we tried it with image from the PC as well by using the URL.The model accurately predicted them.

Thus we can conclude that CNN model with Adam Optimizer is the best one for predicting the Rice Leaf Prediction.

## Suggestion :-
As an Asian, Rice plays a major role in our daily diet.Thus production of healthy rice are very important as well.

Some of the suggestions from our Analysis are :-

Taking the prevention method before the disease get worse.

Awareness programs for every farmers throughout the country.

Give proper instructions,effects and prevention methods.

Provide proper pesticides,fertilizers and quality seeds by the Government can make a big change in farmers life.

## Risks :-
Data Loading and processing.

High computational time.

Optimizer showing less accuracy.

Less information
